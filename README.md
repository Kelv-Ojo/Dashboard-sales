# Dashboard-sales

This project is a Sales Overview Dashboard created in Power BI, designed to provide insights into key sales metrics across multiple years. It enables users to analyze sales trends by comparing Current Year (CY) and Previous Year (PY) data, offering valuable year-over-year (YoY) comparisons to drive business decisions.

Features
Year-over-Year Metrics: Compares metrics between the current and previous years to help identify growth, declines, and patterns in sales performance.
Dynamic Slicing: Allows users to select specific years (e.g., 2021) and automatically handles cases where data for the previous year is unavailable, displaying a "No Data" message for PY when necessary.
Region-Based Analysis: Aggregates sales data by region, providing an average value for each region, which helps to understand regional performance.
